## important

### policy

- please make branches and make a PR, just to avoid merge conflict type nonsense
- if you're on a PR please tick it
- if someone doesn't tick your PR within 48h ping them. if they don't tick after another 48h after that just merge it.
- try not to shit over other people's code (so refactors should be done gently and when you have an endgoal in mind)
- if there's a standard linter for whatever language(s) we're using, we can use that

### goals

- make whatever this is better!
- all contributions welcome
